     <h2>
      About me
     </h2>
     <p> My name is Karan and I am a second year Master of Applied Science candidate at the department of Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I became familiar with Healthcare Human Factors at IUW (Inter-University Workshop) at UofT, last year. </p>
    
     <h2> My Experience </h2>
     <p> Along with my motivation to solve human factors and biomedical problems, simplifying the way people interact with technology through product design is what excites me. With design and engineering experience from the international project titled 'MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) @Work' - designing tools for people with young-onset dementia/MCI, I was assigned with all phases of the UX process, from user research and user requirements to wireframing, prototyping and user testing. <br> <br>As part of my work, I deployed human factors methods like the cognitive task analysis (CTA) and decision-centered design (DCD) to inform the design of prototypes. I created a solid rationale based on months of research, involving focus groups, interviews and led with a focused vision. </p>
     
     <h2> Why Healthcare Human Factors? </h2>
     For the next steps in my career after grad school, I am looking for product designer positions, starting fall (September). I love working with health-based products because of the impact they can potentially make. Having seen the impact of user-centered approaches towards technology design with my own work - designing for and with people with dementia, when I see projects that empower the end-user like prostate cancer survivors (Ned) or creating the right match between technology and healthcare organizations (Procurement Decision Support), it makes me want to learn more and contribute to projects alike. 

     <h2> Why me? </h2>
     My background in computer science coupled with my design and UX experience puts me in a unqiue position where I understand the design and development teams strenghths and contraints. As a result, emphasizing on pragmatic designs, without compromising the user needs and an intuitive user experience. I truly believe in Healthcare Human Factors' notion of embedding human factors in purposeful design in healthcare creating human-centered experience, as a consequence.
